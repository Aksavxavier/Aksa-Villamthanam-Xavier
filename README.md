# DeepDive-Python

Python Programming Course 

This repository contains my solutions for 8 assignments and 1 project from a structured Python curriculum. The course covers fundamental and advanced topics, including data manipulation (NumPy, Pandas), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), GUI programming, web scraping, computer vision (OpenCV), and database integration.

Each assignment focuses on key programming concepts, and the final project integrates multiple skills to solve a real-world problem.

📌 Topics Covered:

Python Basics & OOP
File Handling & Exception Management
NumPy & Pandas for Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Web Scraping & Computer Vision
GUI & Database Integration

🚀 Project:

🚀 Travel Aggregator Analysis – A Python-based data analytics project for the startup MyNextBooking, aimed at optimizing travel booking comparisons across multiple platforms (Yatra, MMT, Goibibo). This project utilizes data analysis and visualization techniques to extract insights from customer bookings, searches, and sessions.

📊 Key Objectives:
✔️ Analyze distinct bookings, sessions, and searches
✔️ Identify peak booking days & most booked routes
✔️ Compute Gross Booking Value (GBV) per service
✔️ Find top departure cities & frequent booking trends
✔️ Detect correlations in booking data via heatmaps
✔️ Study booking trends across device types using time-series analysis
✔️ Calculate Overall Booking to Search Ratio (oBSR) trends

🔧 Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Time-Series Analysis

This project showcases data-driven decision-making for travel aggregators. 🚀✨
